# Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting floods using **Kerala Rainfall Data**. The project implements five different machine learning algorithms to find the best model for accurate flood prediction.

The machine learning algorithms used include:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of floods based on rainfall data in Kerala, using multiple machine learning models. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to select the most accurate model for flood prediction.

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers to ensure the quality of the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generated relevant features from raw rainfall data to improve model performance.
- **Normalization:** Applied feature scaling to standardize the input data for better algorithm performance.

### 2. Model Implementation
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implemented KNN for classification based on proximity to labeled instances.
- **Logistic Regression (LR):** Used Logistic Regression for binary classification to model the probability of floods.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Applied SVM with kernel trick to handle non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Decision Tree (DT):** Built Decision Tree models to capture decision-making rules based on the features.
- **Random Forest (RF):** Utilized Random Forest for ensemble learning to reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Cross-Validation:** Applied k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance across different subsets of data.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared the results of all five models to identify the best-performing one.
